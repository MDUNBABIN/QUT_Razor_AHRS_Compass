# QUT_Razor_AHRS_Compass

This repository has two folders. The "Razor_AHRS_MO_Version" contains the Arduino code required to install on the newer (and smaller) Razor IMUs from Sparkfun. The "Razor_AHRS" folder contains the arduino code for the older Razor IMU that was used in the testing on the QUT rig and intial spin pod testing.
